# Fractol

Fractol is a project aimed to teach 42 students how to work with a graphic library. The graphic library minilibx is given by 42 and the usage is mandatory.
With minilibx you have to create the fractals Mandelbrot and Julia.

## Fractals
A fractal is created based on complex numbers. It follows a formula where you replace some part of the formula with the result of the previous calculation, the
repeated replacing and recalculation is called iteration. You can zoom into fractals nearly infinitely and while zooming in you will find patterns which look similar
to the start pattern (self similarity).

## Mandelbrot
Mandelbrot is a fractol which is created by calculating the formula z<sub>n + 1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c, where z<sub>0</sub> = 0. The value c is the 
fixed value of the pixel in the coordinate system. Depending on the max iteration and the color scheme you can see a variation of details.
